#  Here we write the code for the Binary Search in Python.

# What is Binary Search:-  Binary search is a searching algorithm which is used to search the element in a array and list type of data structure on a condition based.


#  Here we need to find the element enter by the User.


# def binarySearch(num, list1):
#     #  find the start and the end position for the list1.
#     start = 0
#     end = len(list1) - 1

#     while start <= end:
#         #  Find the mid element.
#         mid = start + (end - start) // 2

#         if list1[mid] == num:
#             return True
#         elif list1[mid] < num:
#             start = mid + 1
#         else:
#             end = mid - 1

#     return False


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#     num = int(input("Enter the number"))
#     if binarySearch(num, list1):
#         print("The Number is Found")
#     else:
#         print("The number is not found")

# print(list1)
